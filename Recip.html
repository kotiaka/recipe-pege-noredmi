            <span class="outfit-regular_stail_1">
              In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until
              they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for
              a fluffier texture.

              Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
              pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.

              When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
              runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half
              of the omelette.

              As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and
              fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then
              slide it onto a plate.
